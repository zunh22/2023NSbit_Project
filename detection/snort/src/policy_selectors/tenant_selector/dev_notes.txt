The tenant selector maps configuration to a packet based on the tenant ID in the packet
header.

TenantSelectorModule creates a vector of TenantSelections from the Lua selector table which
is moved to the TenantSelector upon its construction. The PolicySelectUse portion of the
TenantSelections is added to a policy map that is keyed with the tenant IDs. For each
default policy selection, the policy map is queried for a match given the tenant ID.
The match selects the following policies:

* network policy
* inspection policy
* IPS policy
