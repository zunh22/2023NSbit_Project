The address space selector maps configuration to a packet based on the address space
ID in the packet header.

AddressSpaceSelectorModule creates a vector of AddressSpaceSelections from the Lua
selector table which is moved to the AddressSpaceSelector upon its construction. The
PolicySelectUse portion of the AddressSpaceSelections is added to a policy map that
is keyed with the tenant IDs. For each default policy selection, the policy map is
queried for a match given the address space ID. The match selects the following
policies:

* network policy
* inspection policy
* IPS policy
