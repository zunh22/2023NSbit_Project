==== Unit and Benchmark Tests

This directory contains unit-test and benchmark-test interfaces.

In order to enable unit tests, configure snort with --enable-unit-tests.

To enable benchmark tests, configure snort with --enable-benchmark-tests.
For benchmarking is also preferred to configure a non-debug build with
optimizations.
